# FrequencyTable
This is a small c++ project I'm working on mostly for fun. It creates frequency tables for sets of data used as input.

Initially you intput the amount of numbers that you are going to analyze, then just input the numbers themselves one by one (or at once, just separated by a space) and let the magic happen.

It still has bugs and the executable file only works on Mac for now, but I'll be working on it.
