# About
This is a small c++ project I'm working on mostly for fun. It creates frequency tables for sets of data used as input.

It still has bugs and the executable file only works on Mac for now, but I'll be working on it.

# Download Instructions:
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/esMatthew/FrequencyTable/releases) page and search for the latest release. 

Download the zip file and follow the instructions:

- Unzip the app
- Go to finder and locate the executable file in the folder were you downloaded it.
- ***RIGHT-CLICK*** the file and search for the "Open" button in the menu.
- Click "Open"
- A warning should appear, if so, click open again in the warning menu.
- If the warning does not appear, then you're readey to use the utility.

# How to use

Just double click the executable, and a terminal window should appear:

Then, you should input the amount of numbers that your array will have, and lastly all of the elements to organize.

Finally, just hit enter and let the magic happen.
