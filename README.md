# About
This is a small c++ project I'm working on mostly for fun. It creates frequency tables for sets of data used as input.

Initially you intput the amount of numbers that you are going to analyze, then just input the numbers themselves one by one (or at once, just separated by a space) and let the magic happen.

It still has bugs and the executable file only works on Mac for now, but I'll be working on it.

# Download Instructions:
Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/esMatthew/FrequencyTable/releases) page and search for the latest release. 

Download the zip file and follow the instructions:

- Unzip the app
- Go to finder and locate the executable file in the folder were you downloaded it.
- ***RIGHT-CLICK*** the file and search for the "Open" button in the menu.
- Click "Open"
- A warning should appear, if so, click open again in the warning menu.
- If the warning does not appear, then you're readey to use the utility.

### **Warning: The executable file currently only works on mac. If you want to use it, copy the code and compile it in your own machine**
